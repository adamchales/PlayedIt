# PlayedIt
Played It is a Nodejs based web app that allows users to log and review their favorite video games.
I made this app using Nodejs, Express, Mongoose & MongoDB. Images for games are uploaded to cloudinary.
I used bootstrap so that everything was responsive and intuitive. The user sign-in and register functions work.
Passport was used for login information.
